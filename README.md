# Contibution guidelines for Multi-Agent-io projects

## Overall

* Every repo must contain a LICENSE file (We mostly use [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

* Source code in `/src` directory, docs (README, LICENSE, Sphinx) in `/docs` directory, tests in `/test` directory

* We recommend you to use Docker (or docker-compose)

## Benefits of unified code style

This guide includes some code style recommendations as well as best practices. Following these guidelines ensures
minimal level of code quality. Unified code style lets your colleagues and off-site contributors to develop compatible
code for your projects, easily review your code and join the workflow easily.

Following the formatting recommendations ensures your code is easily readable and good-looking. Pretty code is easier to
understand and appears more structured thus limiting the chance of an error.

## General rules

We follow the popular rules that make a good code including, but not limited to:
[DRY](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-dry-development)
, [SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
, [KISS](https://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html)
, [YAGNI](https://dev.to/richardwynn/yagni-principle-in-100-seconds-1i6j). Refer to "Refactoring" and "Clean code" books
or their summaries for more information.
