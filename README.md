# Contibution guidelines for Multi-Agent-io projects

## Overall

* Every repo must contain a LICENSE file (We mostly use [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

* Source code in `/src` directory, docs (README, LICENSE, Sphinx) in `/docs` directory, tests in `/test` directory

* We recommend you to use Docker (or docker-compose)

## Language specific

* [Reference for Python projects](/python/)

* [Reference for JavaScript projects](/javascript/)

* Other languages - feel free to contibute guidelines for any languages
